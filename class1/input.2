Learn
Python
programming
in
preparation
for
an
introduction
to
machine
learning.
No
previous
programming
experience
is
required,
but
learners
must
have
enough
computer
and
algebra
skills
to
complete
the
"Problem
Solving,
Programming,
and
Video
Games"
(PVG)
massive
open
online
course
(MOOC)
hosted
on
Coursera.
In
a
flipped
classroom
format,
PML
1
is
a
supplement
to
the
PVG
MOOC
with
in-class
exercises
and
Q
and
A,
but
the
MOOC
will
*not*
be
taught
in
class.
After
PML
1
and
PML
2,
learners
will
be
able
to
program
and
understand
basic
machine-learning
concepts
and
algorithms.
