Python Programming and Machine Learning

This repository is to track learning and exercises on the topic of python programming and machine learning.

Class 1 - Introduction to python programming
        - Excercises include writting a python program to:
           - accept input from the command line and a text file
           - count 'target words'
           - count 'unique words' 

Class 2 - Expanding python programming
        - Iteritive software development
        - Using a debugger, breakpoints and inspecting variables
        - Variable scope and User-defined functions
        - File I/O and exception handling
        - Additionial python parsing
        
Class 3 - Introduction to Machine Learning
        - Supervised ML and classification
        - Training data
        - Performance and accuaracy metrics 
                - Precision
                - Recall 
                - Ground Truth
        - Challenge assignment to:
                 - Calculate Precision and Recall on a test data file without 
                   being given any target words (create your own target words from the data)
